(formerly OpenAI Gym) and `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io>`_

Install
-------

**coax** is built on top of JAX, but it doesn't have an explicit dependence on the ``jax`` python
package. The reason is that your version of ``jaxlib`` will depend on your CUDA version. To install
without CUDA, simply run:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install jaxlib jax coax --upgrade


If you do require CUDA support, please check out the
`Installation Guide <https://coax.readthedocs.io/examples/getting_started/install.html>`_.


Getting Started
---------------

Have a look at the
`Getting Started <https://coax.readthedocs.io/examples/getting_started/prereq_jax.html>`_ page to
train your first RL agent.
