Regularizers

    coax.regularizers.EntropyRegularizer
    coax.regularizers.KLDivRegularizer

----

This is a collection of regularizers that can be used to put soft constraints on stochastic function
approximators. These is typically added to the loss/objective to avoid premature exploitation of a
policy.
