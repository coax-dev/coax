----

This is a collection of objects that are used to update value functions via *Temporal Difference*
(TD) learning. A state value function :class:`coax.V` is using :class:`coax.td_learning.SimpleTD`.
To update a state-action value function :class:`coax.Q`, there are multiple options available. The
difference between the options are the manner in which the TD-target is constructed.
