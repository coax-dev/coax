FrozenLake with Stochastic Expected-SARSA
=========================================

In this notebook we solve a non-slippery version of the `FrozenLake-v0
<https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/>`_ environment using value-based control with
Expected-SARSA bootstrap targets.

Instead of learning a point estimate for the expected return, we learn the **distribution** over all
possible returns. This approach is known as Distributional RL, see `paper
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887>`_.

We'll use a linear function approximator for our learned distribution. Since the observation space
is discrete, this is equivalent to the table-lookup case.
