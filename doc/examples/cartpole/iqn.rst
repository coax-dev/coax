Cartpole with IQN
=================

In this notebook we solve the `CartPole <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/>`_ environment
using a simple :doc:`IQN </examples/stubs/iqn>` agent. Our function approximator is an Implicit Quantile Network that
approximates the quantiles of the state-action value function.

If training is successful, this is what the result would look like:
